abstract = {? 2016 EURATOM.A new multichannel frequency modulated continuous-wave reflectometry diagnostic has been successfully installed and commissioned on ASDEX Upgrade to measure the plasma edge electron density profile evolution in front of the Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies (ICRF) antenna. The design of the new three-strap ICRF antenna integrates ten pairs (sending and receiving) of microwave reflectometry antennas. The multichannel reflectometer can use three of these to measure the edge electron density profiles up to 2 ? 1019 m-3, at different poloidal locations, allowing the direct study of the local plasma layers in front of the ICRF antenna. ICRF power coupling, operational effects, and poloidal variations of the plasma density profile can be consistently studied for the first time. In this work the diagnostic hardware architecture is described and the obtained density profile measurements were used to track outer radial plasma position and plasma shape.},

abstract = {A multidiagnostic approach, utilizing Langmuir probes in the midplane, X-point and divertor walls, along with lithium beam and infrared measurements is employed to evaluate the evolution of the scrape-off layer (SOL) of ASDEX Upgrade across the L-mode density transition leading to the formation of a density shoulder. The flattening of the SOL density profiles is linked to a regime change of filaments, which become faster and larger, and to a similar flattening of the q ∥ profile. This transition is related to the beginning of outer divertor detachment and leads to the onset of a velocity shear layer in the SOL. Experimental measurements are in good agreement with several filament models which describe the process as a transition from conduction to convection-dominated SOL perpendicular transport caused by an increase of parallel collisionality. These results could be of great relevance since both ITER and DEMO will feature detached divertors and densities largely over the transition values, and might therefore exhibit convective transport levels different to those observed typically in present-day devices.},

With improving confinement, the perpendicular propagation velocity of density fluctuations in the plasma edge increases together with the intermittency of the observed density bursts. Furthermore, it is shown that the weakly coherent mode, a fluctuation feature generally observed in I-mode plasmas, is connected to the observed bursts. It is suggested that the large amplitude density bursts could be generated by a non-linearity similar to that in the Korteweg-de-Vries equation which includes the radial temperature gradient.},

abstract = {L-mode and H-mode density limits with the ITER-like wall (ILW) have been investigated in the recent experimental campaign and compared with experiments in the JET carbon material configuration. The density limit is up to 40{\%} higher in the JET-ILW than in the JET-CFC machine. This is linked to the formerly higher radiation fraction and, correspondingly, to earlier divertor detachment in the JET-CFC. In the ILW configuration, the discharge demonstrates a stable operation with a completely detached outer divertor in L- and H-mode. In contrary to the well-known "heating power independent" Greenwald limit, the L-mode densities limit increases moderately with rising heating power (∼ P0.4
heat) independently of the wall material. The H-L transition constitutes an effective undisruptive density limit for an H-mode plasma. Detachment itself does not trigger the H-L back transition and does not present a limit on plasma density. In the range of neutral beam heating 8-10.5 MW, no dependence of the H-mode density limit on the heating power was observed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Euratom. Published by Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {? 2016 EURATOM.Experiments have been performed under the coordination of the International Tokamak Physics Activity (ITPA) on several tokamaks, including ASDEX Upgrade (AUG), JET and DIII-D, to characterize the increased Ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF) antenna loading achieved by optimizing the position of gas injection relative to the RF antennas. On DIII-D, AUG and JET (with the ITER-Like Wall) a 50{\%} increase in the antenna loading was observed when injecting deuterium in ELMy H-mode plasmas using mid-plane inlets close to the powered antennas instead of divertor injection and, with smaller improvement when using gas inlets located at the top of the machine. The gas injection rate required for such improvements (?0.7 ? 1022 el s-1 in AUG, ?1.0 ? 1022 el s-1 in JET) is compatible with the use of this technique to optimize ICRF heating during the development of plasma scenarios and no degradation of confinement was observed when using the mid-plane or top inlets compared with divertor valves. An increase in the scrape-off layer (SOL) density was measured when switching gas injection from divertor to outer mid-plane or top. On JET and DIII-D, the measured SOL density increase when using main chamber puffing is consistent with the antenna coupling resistance increase provided that the distance between the measurement lines of sight and the injection location is taken into account. Optimized gas injection was also found to be beneficial for reducing tungsten (W) sputtering at the AUG antenna limiters, and also to reduce slightly the W and nickel (Ni) content in JET plasmas. Modeling the specific effects of divertor/top/mid-plane injection on the outer mid-plane density was carried out using both the EDGE2D-EIRENE and EMC3-EIRENE plasma boundary code packages; simulations indeed indicate that outer mid-plane gas injection maximizes the density in the mid-plane close to the injection point with qualitative agreement with the AUG SOL density measurements for EMC3-EIRENE. Field line tracing for ITER in the 15 MA QDT = 10 reference scenario indicates that the planned gas injection system could be used to tailor the density in front the antennas. Benchmarking of EMC3-EIRENE against AUG and JET data is planned as a first step towards the ITER SOL modelling required to quantify the effect of gas injection on the SOL density in front of the antennas.},

A MARFE is a toroidally symmetric tokamak phenomenon occuring at minor radii near the plasma boundary, defined by a limiter or magnetic separatrix. The MARFE poloidal width is approximately 30?? in extent at the smaller major radius edge of the plasma. It is characterized by greatly increased radiation, high ion densities and density fluctuations, and relatively low electron temperature. These changes in the edge plasma are consistent with the MARFE being the manifestation of a thermal instability. MARFEs tend to occur in most tokamaks at similar values of ?? = ne ??J, a fraction of the density disruption limit. A related phenomenon, the detached plasma, is different in that the boundary layer radiation emission is poloidally symmetric. The radiated power, in this case, is approximately equal to the input power, thereby reducing power flows to the limiter to negligible values. A review of experimental data and theoretical treatments of MARFEs and detached plasmas are provided herein. The relationship between boundary layer parameter scalings, the MARFE threshold and the density limit is explored. ?? 1987.},

The marfe appears to be confined to minor radii greater than or of the order of that of the limiter. The affected region is typically above the midplane, extending poloidally for about 30° and toroidally for 360°. The temperature and density of the core plasma are unaffected by the marfe.

abstract = {The discovery of advanced tokamak scenarios opened new possibilities for the realization of more compact machines with long pulse operation. This requires the simultaneous optimization of the plasma shape, and of the pressure, current and electric field profiles. In this complex process the diagnostics are crucial to understand the plasma physics, to validate the theoretical models and to measure parameters for control purposes. Here we present results obtained in ASDEX Upgrade showing the great potential of reflectometry for conventional and advanced tokamak investigation, derived from the diagnostic capability to perform a wide range of measurements with high spatial and temporal resolution, both at the edge and plasma core. The abrupt formation of sharp density gradients at the zones where internal and external transport barriers are formed, as well as the modifications of the turbulence parameters in those narrow plasma regions are shown. Density profile changes associated with fast events like ELMs and the L-H transition are resolved. Enhanced fluctuations that may be important for the transport across the edge barrier are also detected by reflectometry. The measurement of the radial profile of E×B velocity on ASDEX Upgrade is discussed and results are compared with vE×B profiles obtained in W7-AS stellarator. The first experimental demonstration that edge density profiles from reflectometry can provide accurate and reliable measurements of the temporal evolution of the plasma position is presented. This is essential to prove that reflectometry can be used as an alternative approach to supplement the magnetic measurements, for the control of plasma shape and position in long pulse operation, as it is proposed for ITER. Finally new applications of reflectometry under development are discussed.},

abstract = {D2 gas injected into ELMing H-mode discharges in DIII-D reduced the total integrated heat flux to the divertor ???2?? and the peak heat flux ???5??, with only modest degradation to plasma stored energy. Steady gas injection without particle pumping results in eventual degradation in stored energy. The initial reduction in peak heat flux at the divertor tiles may be primarily due to the increase in radiated power from the X-point/divertor region. The eventual formation of a high density region near the X-point appears to play a role in momentum (and energy) transfer from the flux surfaces near the outboard strike point to flux surfaces farther out into the scrape-off. This may also contribute to further reduction in peak heat flux. ?? 1992 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The physics of diverters in tokamaks is reviewed, primarily from an experimental point of view, although where possible simple analytic modelling is included. The paper covers the four main subject areas at issue in divertor research: (1) the wide dispersal of plasma power exhausted from the main plasma, (2) the production of sufficiently high gas pressures in the vicinity of pump ducts to enable the removal of fuel and helium ('ash') gas from the system, (3) the elimination or reduction of impurity production and (4) the screening of impurities produced, or intentionally added, at the plasma boundary from the plasma core. A simple analytic model, the 'two-point' model, is introduced early in the paper and provides a framework for comparison of the experimental results, drawn from many machines, with simply derived expectations. Conclusions regarding the direction of future research priorities are made.},

Substantial cost reductions can be achieved if one of these two divertors is eliminated. The new strategy implies not only that ITER would start-up on a full-W divertor, but that this component should survive until well into the nuclear phase.

For this purpose, a series of ohmic and L-mode density ramp discharges at different heating powers, magnetic field directions and plasma species were carried out. For the first time at ASDEX Upgrade the electron density in the divertor volume and the occurrence of volume recombination were measured by means of spectroscopy. It is shown that detachment is not a continuously evolving process but rather undergoes three distinct states while the characteristics of the inner and outer divertor are strongly coupled. Before the complete detachment of the inner and outer divertor, radiative fluctuations occur in the inner divertor close to the X-point, observed for the first time via new fast diode bolometers. Finally, the effect of an externally applied magnetic perturbation field on the detachment process is investigated.},

The electron density in the divertor volume is determined with a spectroscopic measurement of the Stark broadened D $\epsilon$ line shape. These measurements are combined with several other diagnostics, yielding a consistent picture of detachment. It will be shown that detachment in ASDEX Upgrade is not a continuously evolving process but can be divided into three different states. Within these states, the conditions in the inner and outer divertor are strongly coupled. Radiative fluctuations, measured with fast diode bolometers, combined with a region of high electron density appear at the X-point during one of these states. We show how N2 seeding during this state alters the divertor conditions.

The high-field side high density (HFSHD) occurs about 10×$\lambda$q away from the separatrix and about 20cm above the X-point. To trigger the HFSHD, the inner divertor has to be detached while the outer one remains attached and the heating power has to be sufficiently high. The HFSHD, determined independently from spectroscopic and interferometric measurements, is clearly correlated with neutral fluxes in the far scrape-off layer; both increase with heating power. Injection of N2 into the divertor private flux region suppresses the HFSHD in AUG and JET.

abstract = {Microwave O-mode reflectometry is a diagnostic technique that will play an important supplementary role for plasma position control for ITER and forseeably for DEMO. Density profiles from reflectometry will provide, at high temporal resolutions, estimates of the gap between the plasma magnetic separatrix and the tokamak vessel walls. These estimates will be used to detect and correct drifts in the magnetic gap measurements, the primary measurements used for plasma position and shape control. The feasibility of this alternative feedback control approach was demonstrated in 2011 on ASDEX Upgrade (AUG)  , where the reflectometry gap estimate actually replaced the corresponding magnetic measurement in the position control loop. Presently, the AUG?s real-time (RT) reflectometry diagnostic is being upgraded to improve not only its density range coverage but also its acquisition and RT data processing performance. The diagnostic is now capable of acquiring a total of 16 channels (previously 8) from which 8, corresponding to microwave bands K, Ka, Q and V from both the high (HFS) and low field side (LFS) reflectometers, are used in the RT density profile and separatrix gap calculations. The modern NUMA hardware architecture of the updated data processing server allows for an efficient and separate handling of the data-flows produced by the hosted acquisition systems. The higher RAM and CPU interconnection bandwidths allow the implementation of new operation modes that exploit the very high data throughput (  {\textgreater}  1.2 GB/s ) of each of the two used acquisition boards. RT reconstruction of the density profiles is a complex algorithm, whose performance will also be improved by the additional processing power (16 cores instead of 8). The system was specified to acquire and store HFS and LFS density profile data every   whilst simultaneously producing profile measurements for RT control every 1?ms. In this new operation mode, identical to the one planned for the ITER plasma position reflectometer (PPR), the diagnostic can reach an inbound data throughput (ADCs to RT processing host) and a computational load that are closer to the ones expected to be generated by each of the planned 4 ITER PPRs (   ? 3  GB/s maximum inbound and outbound data stream bandwidth per PPR). Herein we discuss the enhancements introduced in the AUG?s RT reflectometry diagnostic to implement the new operation mode and perform the aimed control experiments. Preliminary RT experimental data obtained in both the HFS and LFS is shown to illustrate the system?s plasma position and shape control capabilities to be demonstrated during AUG?s 2014 experimental campaign.},

abstract = {The B2-Eirene code package was developed to give better insight into the physics in the scrape-off layer (SOL), which is defined as the region of open field-lines intersecting walls. The SOL is characterised by the competition of parallel and perpendicular transport defining by this a 2D system. The description of the plasma-wall interaction due to the existence of walls and atomic processes are necessary ingredients for an understanding of the scrape-off layer. This paper concentrates on understanding the basic physics by combining the results of the code with experiments and analytical models or estimates. This work will mainly focus on divertor tokamaks, but most of the arguments and principles can be easily adapted also to other concepts like island divertors in stellarators or limiter devices. The paper presents the basic equations for the plasma transport and the basic models for the neutral transport. This defines the basic ingredients for the SOLPS (Scrape-Off Layer Plasma Simulator) code package. A first level of understanding is approached for pure hydrogenic plasmas based both on simple models and simulations with B2-Eirene neglecting drifts and currents. The influence of neutral transport on the different operation regimes is here the main topic. This will finish with time-dependent phenomena for the pure plasma, so-called Edge Localised Modes (ELMs). Then, the influence of impurities on the SOL plasma is discussed. For the understanding of impurity physics in the SOL one needs a rather complex combination of different aspects. The impurity production process has to be understood, then the effects of impurities in terms of radiation losses have to be included and finally impurity transport is necessary. This will be introduced with rising complexity starting with simple estimates, analysing then the detailed parallel force balance and the flow pattern of impurities. Using this, impurity compression and radiation instabilities will be studied. This part ends, combining all the elements introduced before, with specific, detailed results from different machines. Then, the effect of drifts and currents is introduced and their consequences presented. Finally, some work on deriving scaling laws for the anomalous turbulent transport based on automatic edge transport code fitting procedures will be described. {\textcopyright} 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

The inherently strong plasma-wall interaction of TJ-II has been successfully reduced after lithium coating by vacuum evaporation. Besides H retention and low Z, Li was chosen because there exists a reactor-oriented interest in this element, thus giving special relevance to the investigation of its properties. The Li-coating has led to important changes in plasma performance. Particularly, the effective density limit in NBI plasmas has been extended reaching central values of 8 ? 1019 m-3 and Te ? 250-300 eV, with peaked density, rather flat Te profiles and higher ion temperatures. Due to the achieved density control, a second type of transition has been added to the low density ones previously observed in ECRH plasmas: higher density transitions characterized by the fall in H? emission, the onset of steep density gradient and the reduction in the turbulence; which are characteristics of transition to the H mode. Confinement studies in ECH plasmas indicate that lowest order magnetic resonances, even in a low shear environment, locally reduce the effective electron heat diffusivities, while Alfven eigenmodes destabilized in NBI plasmas can influence fast ion confinement. ? 2009 IAEA, Vienna.},

abstract = {A new set of diagnostics has been implemented on ASDEX Upgrade to measure the input impedance of the ICRF antennas, in the form of a voltage and current probe pair installed on each feeding line of every antenna. Besides allowing the measurement of the reflection coefficient ? of each antenna port, the probes have two advantages: first, they are located close to the antenna ports (?3 m) and thus the measurements are not affected by the uncertainties due to the transmission and matching network; second, they are independent of matching conditions. These diagnostics have been used to study the behavior of the ASDEX Upgrade antennas while changing the plasma shape (low to high triangularity) and applying magnetic perturbations (MPs) via saddle coils. Scans in the separatrix position Rsep were also performed. Upper triangularity ?o was increased from 0.1 to 0.3 (with the lower triangularity ?u kept roughly constant at 0.45) and significant decreases in |?| (up to ?30{\%}, markedly improving antenna coupling) and moderate changes in phase (up to ?5?) of ? on each feeding line were observed approximately at ?o ? 0.29. During MPs (in ?0.5 s pulses with a coil current of 1 kA), a smaller response was observed: 6{\%} - 7{\%} in |?|, with changes in phase of ?5? apparently due to Rsep scans only. As |?| is usually in the range 0.8 - 0.9, this still leads to a significant increase in possible coupled power. Numerical simulations of the antenna behavior were carried out using the FELICE code; the simulation results are in qualitative agreement with experimental measurements. The results presented here complement the studies on the influence of gas injection and MPs on the ICRF antenna performance presented in [4]. ? 2014 American Institute of Physics.},

The present work extends previous studies by using the input impedance (more precisely, the complex voltage reflection coefficient -) on each antenna port for comparison, instead of the more commonly used loading resistance or coupled power. The electron density profiles used for the simulation were reconstructed from the deuterium-carbon-nitrogen interferometer and lithium beam emission spectroscopy measurements, edge-localized mode-synchronized and averaged over time intervals from 10 to 200 ms depending on the case; 112 cases were compared from seven ASDEX Upgrade discharges with widely different plasma parameters and two operating frequencies (30 and 36.5 MHz). Very good agreement in (?)was found with the measurements on antenna 3 ({\textless}3{\%} averaged over a shot), and good agreement was found with antennas 1 and 2 ({\textless}10{\%}); the code reproduced the correct trend in loading resistance RL in a significant majority of cases, although the discrepancies in the absolute values were rather high (up to ?50{\%}) due to high reflection.

abstract = {The medium size divertor tokamak ASDEX Upgrade (major and minor radii 1.65 m and 0.5 m, respectively, magnetic-field strength 2.5 T) possesses flexible shaping and versatile heating and current drive systems. Recently the technical capabilities were extended by increasing the electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) power, by installing 2 ? 8 internal magnetic perturbation coils, and by improving the ion cyclotron range of frequency compatibility with the tungsten wall. With the perturbation coils, reliable suppression of large type-I edge localized modes (ELMs) could be demonstrated in a wide operational window, which opens up above a critical plasma pedestal density. The pellet fuelling efficiency was observed to increase which gives access to H-mode discharges with peaked density profiles at line densities clearly exceeding the empirical Greenwald limit. Owing to the increased ECRH power of 4 MW, H-mode discharges could be studied in regimes with dominant electron heating and low plasma rotation velocities, i.e. under conditions particularly relevant for ITER. The ion-pressure gradient and the neoclassical radial electric field emerge as key parameters for the transition. Using the total simultaneously available heating power of 23 MW, high performance discharges have been carried out where feed-back controlled radiative cooling in the core and the divertor allowed the divertor peak power loads to be maintained below 5 MW m -2. Under attached divertor conditions, a multi-device scaling expression for the power-decay length was obtained which is independent of major radius and decreases with magnetic field resulting in a decay length of 1 mm for ITER. At higher densities and under partially detached conditions, however, a broadening of the decay length is observed. In discharges with density ramps up to the density limit, the divertor plasma shows a complex behaviour with a localized high-density region in the inner divertor before the outer divertor detaches. Turbulent transport is studied in the core and the scrape-off layer (SOL). Discharges over a wide parameter range exhibit a close link between core momentum and density transport. Consistent with gyro-kinetic calculations, the density gradient at half plasma radius determines the momentum transport through residual stress and thus the central toroidal rotation. In the SOL a close comparison of probe data with a gyro-fluid code showed excellent agreement and points to the dominance of drift waves. Intermittent structures from ELMs and from turbulence are shown to have high ion temperatures even at large distances outside the separatrix. ? 2013 IAEA, Vienna.},

abstract = {The understanding of confinement improvement through the formation and sustainment of localized transport barriers requires diagnostics with high temporal and spatial resolutions. One diagnostic that can meet such high requirements is broadband microwave reflectometry. In particular, it can measure the density profile with better than 30 s temporal resolution and millimetre spatial resolution. The main difficulty has always been the evaluation of the density profile in the presence of plasma turbulence. Recent advances in the data analysis techniques and the high performance of the reflectometry diagnostic enabled the automatic and routine evaluation of density profiles in all plasma regimes of ASDEX Upgrade. The large number of profiles measured during a discharge makes it possible to obtain the detailed evolution of plasma parameters crucial for transport analysis, such as the edge pedestal density, even under moderate levels of plasma fluctuations. Here a new method is presented that automatically extracts the temporal evolution of the edge pedestal density from the measured group delays. To reduce the effect of plasma fluctuations and to improve the accuracy of the pedestal detection, the method can use burst sequences of closely spaced reflectometry samples. The automatic evaluation of the pedestal was applied to ASDEX Upgrade standard H-mode plasmas. The results presented show that reflectometry can accurately detect the formation of the edge pedestal at the L to H transition, and also that the detailed evolution of the density profile can be resolved, in particular during ELMs (edge localized modes).},

This is a complex task due to the effects of plasma turbulence on the probing microwaves.

Here we review the evolution of the data processing techniques for profile evaluation. We first describe the standard methods that have been applied in ASDEX Upgrade (as well as in other machines) and discuss their advantages and limitations. Secondly, the novel techniques implemented in ASDEX Upgrade are presented and the resulting improvements on profile evaluation are discussed. It is shown that these are due to the ability to use both the a priori knowledge about profile measurements and the advanced features of the ASDEX Upgrade reflectometry diagnostic.},

An inter-ELM phase of an H-mode discharge with a moderate gas puff rate (1.2 1022 electrons s-1) is used in our simulations. We simulated cases with gas puff in the lower divertor, the outer mid-plane and the top of the machine while keeping other conditions the same. Compared with the lower divertor gas puff, the outer mid-plane gas puff can increase the local density in front of the antennas most effectively, while a toroidally uniform but significantly smaller enhancement is found for the top gas puff. Good agreement between our simulations and experiments is obtained. With further simulations, the mechanisms of SOL density tailoring via local gas puffing and the strategies of gas puff optimization are discussed in the paper.},

abstract = {? 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.In magnetic controlled fusion devices, plasma heating with radio-frequency (RF) waves in the ion cyclotron (IC) range of frequency relies on the electric field of the fast wave to heat the plasma. However, the slow wave can be generated parasitically. The electric field of the slow wave can induce large biased plasma potential (DC potential) through sheath rectification. The rapid variation of the rectified potential across the equilibrium magnetic field can cause significant convective transport (E ? B drifts) in the scrape-off layer (SOL). In order to understand this phenomenon and reproduce the experiments, 3D realistic simulations are carried out with the 3D edge plasma fluid and kinetic neutral code EMC3-Eirene in ASDEX Upgrade. For this, we have added the prescribed drift terms to the EMC3 equations and verified the 3D code results against the analytical ones in cylindrical geometry. The edge plasma potential derived from the experiments is used to calculate the drift velocities, which are then treated as input fields in the code to obtain the final density distributions. Our simulation results are in good agreement with the experiments.},

  abstract={Experimental evidence for the impact of a region of high density localised in the high-field side scrape-off layer (the HFSHD) on plasma confinement is shown in various dedicated experiments on ASDEX Upgrade (AUG). Increasing main ion fuelling is shown to increase the separatrix density and shift the density profile outwards. Predictive pedestal modelling of this shift indicates a 25\% decrease in the attainable pedestal top pressure, which compares well with experimental observations in the gas scan. Since the HFSHD can be mitigated by applying nitrogen seeding, a combined scan in fuelling rate, heating power, and nitrogen seeding is presented. Significant increases in the achievable pedestal top pressure are observed with seeding, in particular at high heating powers, and are correlated with inward shifted density profiles and a reduction of the HFSHD and separatrix density. Interpretive linear stability analysis also confirms the impact of a radially shifted pressure profile on peeling-ballooning stability, with an inward shift allowing access to higher pressure gradients and pedestal widths.}

  abstract={Detachment of high power discharges is obtained in ASDEX Upgrade by simultaneous feedback control of core radiation and divertor radiation or thermoelectric currents by the injection of radiating impurities. So far 2/3 of the ITER normalized heat flux P sep / R=15MWm −1 has been obtained in ASDEX Upgrade under partially detached conditions with a peak target heat flux well below 10MWm −2 . When the detachment is further pronounced towards lower peak heat flux at the target, substantial changes in edge localized mode (ELM) behaviour, density and radiation distribution occur. The time-averaged peak heat flux at both divertor targets can be reduced below 2MWm −2 , which offers an attractive DEMO divertor scenario with potential for simpler and cheaper technical solutions. Generally, pronounced detachment leads to a pedestal and core density rise by about 20–40%, moderate (<20%) confinement degradation and a reduction of ELM size. For AUG conditions, some operational challenges occur, like the density cut-off limit for X-2 electron cyclotron resonance heating, which is used for central tungsten control.}

It is thereby possible to study the response of the detachment evolution to the control parameters (SOL input power, upstream density and impurity fraction) prevailing during the inter-ELM periods and the effect of ELMs on the detached divertor. A relatively comprehensive overview is achieved, including the interaction with the targets at various stages of the ELM cycle, the role of ELMs in affecting the detachment process and the overall performance of the scenario. The results are consistent with previous studies in devices with an ITER-like, metal wall, with the important advance of distinguishing data from intra- and inter-ELM periods. Operation without significant degradation of the core confinement can be sustained in the presence of strong radiation from the x-point region (MARFE).}

  abstract={In addition to the relaxation of the pedestal, edge localised modes (ELMs) introduce changes to the divertor and scrape-off layer (SOL) conditions. Their impact on the inter-ELM pedestal recovery is investigated, with emphasis on the electron density ( n e ) evolution. The typical ELM cycle occurring in an exemplary ASDEX Upgrade discharge interval at moderate applied gas puff and heating power is characterised, utilising several divertor, SOL and pedestal diagnostics. In the studied discharge interval the inner divertor target is detached before the ELM crash, while the outer target is attached. The particles and power expelled by the ELM crash lead to a re-attachment of the inner target plasma. After the ELM crash, the outer divertor target moves into a high recycling regime with large n e in front of the plate, which is accompanied by high main chamber neutral fluxes. On similar timescales, the inner target fully detaches and the high field side high density region (HFSHD) is formed reaching up to the high field side midplane. This state evolves again to the pre-ELM state, when the main chamber neutral fluxes are reduced later in the ELM cycle. Neither the timescale of the appearance of the HFSHD nor the increase of the main chamber neutral fluxes fit the timescale of the n e pedestal, which is faster. It is found that during the n e pedestal recovery, the magnetic activity at the low field side midplane is strongly reduced indicating a lower level of fluctuations. A rough estimation of the particle flux across the pedestal suggests that the particle flux is reduced in this period. In conclusion, the evolution of the n e pedestal is determined by a combination of neutral fluxes, HFSHD and reduced particle flux across the pedestal. A reduced particle flux explains the fast, experimentally observed re-establishment of the n e pedestal best, whereas neutrals and HFSHD impact on the evolution of the SOL and separatrix conditions.}

In the region of the edge transport barrier in ELMy H-mode, the gradient lengths of T e and n e are found closely coupled, with the temperature decay length two times shorter than the density decay length corresponding to η e ≈ 2. The η e constraint allows us to calculate the electron temperature and density profiles from the pressure profile if the density and temperature values are known at one spatial position. The edge density in the region of the barrier foot is closely coupled to the main chamber recycling, with no strong dependence on other parameters. In contrast, the density rise from the outer barrier foot to the pedestal exhibits pronounced dependence on plasma current and shaping, indicating quite different mechanisms determining the absolute density and its gradient.}

  abstract={Results of experimental scans of heating power, plasma shape, and nitrogen content are presented, with a focus on global performance and pedestal alteration. In detailed scans at low triangularity, it is shown that the increase in stored energy due to nitrogen seeding stems from the pedestal. It is also shown that the confinement increase is driven through the temperature pedestal at the three heating power levels studied. In a triangularity scan, an orthogonal effect of shaping and seeding is observed, where increased plasma triangularity increases the pedestal density, while impurity seeding (carbon and nitrogen) increases the pedestal temperature in addition to this effect. Modelling of these effects was also undertaken, with interpretive and predictive models being employed. The interpretive analysis shows a general agreement of the experimental pedestals in separate power, shaping, and seeding scans with peeling-ballooning theory. Predictive analysis was used to isolate the individual effects, showing that the trends of additional heating power and increased triangularity can be recoverd. However, a simple change of the effective charge in the plasma cannot explain the observed levels of confinement improvement in the present models.}

abstract = {Large poloidal asymmetries in density, electron temperature, radial density e-folding length and floating potential have been measured in the plasma existing between the limiter radius and the wall of the Alcator C tokamak. Typically, variations in density by factors of about 4–20 and variations in radial density e-folding length by factors of about 3–8 are recorded in discharges which are bounded by poloidally symmetric ring limiters. These poloidal asymmetries show that pressure is a function of poloidal angle on open magnetic flux surfaces in this region of the plasma. Observations of toroidally symmetric MARFE phenomena further imply that density and perhaps pressure are also a function of poloidal angle on closed flux surfaces existing just inside the limiter radius. The magnitude of these poloidal asymmetries and their dependence on poloidal angle persists independent of machine parameters (central plasma density, plasma current, toroidal field, MARFE versus non-MARFE discharges). Analysis of the data indicates that these asymmetries are caused by poloidal variations in perpendicular particle and heat transport in both the main plasma and the scrape-off layer. A number of possible asymmetric perpendicular transport processes in the scrape-off layer plasma are examined, including diffusion and × plasma convection.},

abstract = {Fast reconstruction of plasma density profiles, for the feedback control of plasma position, is an important research topic in the design of the ITER international tokamak, a device being built to demonstrate the viability of fusion energy. Microwave reflectometry is a diagnostic (radar) technique that is particularly suited to provide density profile measurements in the harsh environment of a fusion reactor. Producing, in real-time, plasma position data from the density profile is a new reflectometry application that must be demonstrated in present fusion devices before being applied to ITER. In this thesis, we present a novel data analysis approach aiming at the real-time reconstruction of the density profile. The method, based on the joint use of time-frequency analysis and neural networks, can be used to reliably track the edge plasma position, meeting the ITER spatial and time resolution requirements. Questions such as the missing reflectometry data for the lowest incident frequencies and the effects of plasma turbulence, that cause scattering and refraction of the probing microwaves, are addressed by the proposed technique. Its performance is assessed using realistic simulation data as well as using ASDEX Upgrade experimental data, obtained in ITER relevant scenarios.},

abstract = {A reflectometry system has been developed for ASDEX Upgrade to measure the plasma profile from the scrape-off layer until the bulk plasma, simultaneously at the high and low field sides. Unique features of the system are the ultrafast broadband frequency modulation of a continuous wave using solid state stable hyper abrupt tuned oscillators ͑down to 10 s͒, high and low field side channels and fully remote control operation, via optical fiber links. Due to the special design of the transmission line, with decoupled in going and out going lines and one-antenna configuration, the system is optimized for reception and spurious reflections are eliminated. The ultrafast operation guarantees that the effect of plasma turbulence is greatly reduced. Both features determine the high performance of the diagnostic. A dedicated data acquisition system handles the large amounts of data generated by the broadband operation. Recent developments include the operation of new channels and an automatic and accurate frequency calibration circuit. Also, advanced digital signal processing techniques were applied to obtain density profiles with high spatial and temporal ͑20 s͒ resolutions under turbulent plasma regions, e.g., the scrape-off layer. Experimental results are presented showing the great sensitivity of the diagnostic to plasma radial movements and its tolerance to vertical movements of the plasma. Density profiles measured in ELMy regimes illustrate the capabilities of the diagnostic to detect fast profile changes.},

Asymmetries favoring the outboard side are observed in density, turbulent particle flux and diffusion coefficient independently of the toroidal magnetic field direction, suggesting a ballooning-like transport. This interpretation is supported by the characteristics of the fluctuations as they are found to be more intermittent on the outboard side. In addition, up/down asymmetries reversing with the reversal of the toroidal magnetic field direction are found. Significant poloidal asymmetries were also measured in the parallel flow that can be attributed mainly to Pfirsch-Schluter flows. ?? 2010 Published by B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents the latest results on confinement studies in the TJ-II stellarator. The inherently strong plasma-wall interaction of TJ-II has been successfully reduced after lithium coating by vacuum evaporation. Besides H retention and low Z, Li was chosen because there exists a reactor-oriented interest in this element, thus giving special relevance to the investigation of its properties. The Li-coating has led to important changes in plasma performance. Particularly, the effective density limit in NBI plasmas has been extended reaching central values of 8 ? 1019 m-3 and Te ? 250-300 eV, with peaked density, rather flat Te profiles and higher ion temperatures. Due to the achieved density control, a second type of transition has been added to the low density ones previously observed in ECRH plasmas: higher density transitions characterized by the fall in H? emission, the onset of steep density gradient and the reduction in the turbulence; which are characteristics of transition to the H mode. Confinement studies in ECH plasmas indicate that lowest order magnetic resonances, even in a low shear environment, locally reduce the effective electron heat diffusivities, while Alfven eigenmodes destabilized in NBI plasmas can influence fast ion confinement. ? 2009 IAEA, Vienna.},

abstract = {? 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.Broadband swept (i.e. frequency modulation of the continuous wave; FM-CW) and fixed frequency reflectometry (FFR) were used for the first time to study plasma filamentary activity; experiments were performed in ELMy H-mode plasmas at the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak. Electron density profiles were studied with FM-CW providing a first insight into filamentary activity and enabling us to localize the density layers probed with FFR. A novel filament detection technique was developed using a threshold criterion on the phase derivative signals from FFR. This technique was applied together with conditional averaging in measurements performed in the vicinity of the separatrix. Results showed good agreement with data from Langmuir probes and it was found that the majority of filaments propagate with dominant poloidal velocity in both periods of in-between edge localized modes (ELMs) (V? ? 575 m s-1) and at the ELM onset (V? ? 1180 m s-1). A time delay between the maximum filament activity at the outer mid-plane and the ELM peak at the inner divertor currents (? -461 ? 50 ?s) agrees with expected time scales for the ELM lifetime. In inter-ELM periods we were able to estimate typical poloidal and toroidal sizes of filaments (S? ? [5.75-11.50] cm and S? ? [33-66] cm) and a magnetohydrodynamic mode structure emerged from the measurements with poloidal and toroidal mode numbers (m ? [8-12] and n ? [2, 3]) in the range of possible peeling-ballooning modes.},

Furthermore, electron density fluctuations are measured using Li-BES. The Li-BES capabilities and limitations to measure electron density profiles as well as density fluctuations are presented. It is well suited to characterize electron density turbulence in the scrape off layer (SOL) with decreasing sensitivity towards the plasma core.

abstract = {? 2016 EURATOM.In recent experiments, a local gas puff was found to be an effective way to tailor the scrape-off layer (SOL) density and improve the ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF) power coupling in tokamaks. In order to quantitatively reproduce these experiments, to understand the corresponding physics and to optimize the gas valve positions and rates, simulations were carried out with the 3D edge plasma transport code EMC3-EIRENE in ASDEX Upgrade. An inter-ELM phase of an H-mode discharge with a moderate gas puff rate (1.2 1022 electrons s-1) is used in our simulations. We simulated cases with gas puff in the lower divertor, the outer mid-plane and the top of the machine while keeping other conditions the same. Compared with the lower divertor gas puff, the outer mid-plane gas puff can increase the local density in front of the antennas most effectively, while a toroidally uniform but significantly smaller enhancement is found for the top gas puff. Good agreement between our simulations and experiments is obtained. With further simulations, the mechanisms of SOL density tailoring via local gas puffing and the strategies of gas puff optimization are discussed in the paper.},

abstract = {? 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.In magnetic controlled fusion devices, plasma heating with radio-frequency (RF) waves in the ion cyclotron (IC) range of frequency relies on the electric field of the fast wave to heat the plasma. However, the slow wave can be generated parasitically. The electric field of the slow wave can induce large biased plasma potential (DC potential) through sheath rectification. The rapid variation of the rectified potential across the equilibrium magnetic field can cause significant convective transport (E ? B drifts) in the scrape-off layer (SOL). In order to understand this phenomenon and reproduce the experiments, 3D realistic simulations are carried out with the 3D edge plasma fluid and kinetic neutral code EMC3-Eirene in ASDEX Upgrade. For this, we have added the prescribed drift terms to the EMC3 equations and verified the 3D code results against the analytical ones in cylindrical geometry. The edge plasma potential derived from the experiments is used to calculate the drift velocities, which are then treated as input fields in the code to obtain the final density distributions. Our simulation results are in good agreement with the experiments.},
